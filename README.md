#### The Request

Hi Support,

I was looking at your JS API documentation (http://cdn.openfin.co/jsdocs/stable/index.html) and am running into issues making a new window.  I would also like to see my main and child windows talking to each other with the InterApplication Bus. Would you be able to help me with this?  I am a simple kind of guy so an example would be best for me.  

Any other tips would also be appreciated.
